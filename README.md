# Whateversauc3 - a place to learn crap 

Greetz Internet friend! I'm sauc3 and this is a page I built to learn about Jekyll. I created this site while on a break between infosec jobs because I was interested in learning more about web application penetration testing and heard that static sites like Jekyll were more secure than other options. I've always held the opinion that knowing how to build something makes you more effective at breaking it. I also wanted to be able to say I'd actually worked with Jekyll if I end up recommending it to people.

So I'm going to be sharing stuff I learn along the way, stuff I've learned so far, and stuff I think is cool. If you dig it, that's great - tell a friend! If you don't dig it, that's a bummer, but I'm not for everyone. 

If you have any questions, give me a holler on Twitter. I tweet @whatever\_sauce 

This theme is called hacker, you can find it [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)

Cheers!
